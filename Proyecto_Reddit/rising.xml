All the other cars I've had are black inside because I either bought them used or was too cheap (in the case of the Model 3).

I love these things but they CAN (not always but sometimes) remove surface protection on certain materials like bathtubs or sinks which makes those things more susceptible to staining. Again, I love them for most cleaning tasks but they're not for everything.

</comment><comment id="g9r9bs2" postid="jgap76" date="2020-10-23 00:57:39">It definitely seems a bit fishy that so few and low quality videos are out there. The only theories I have about it are these, some of which may overlap.

1. Extremely few people got it, and don't want to post about it. Like literally fewer than a dozen people.

2. Tesla prohibits posting about it through some NDAs or has to explicitly give a permission for each video and they are slow about it.

3. The ability of the current software unfortunately kinda sucks and Tesla only allows people to post limited footage of it when it actually works.

Honestly I don't know. I would have expected a ton of videos, showing at length a 15min commute for example. I have the utmost faith that Tesla will eventually succeed in this, but I gotta admit that the number of videos and the fact it is some crappy few seconds videos here and there is kinda fishy. I hope when more people get it in the next few weeks I will be proven wrong.

Level 2 is the car is capable of doing some of the driving itself while being monitored. Level 3 is the car is capable of driving from Point A to Point B by itself but it needs to be monitored.

So by definition FSD should be Level 3 at this point.

We know all that.  But this is a complete different level we're talking about here.  This level of 'self driving' requires even more attention than autopilot since it has many more liberties.  I think that's obvious.

</comment><comment id="g9r53mg" postid="jgkupo" date="2020-10-23 12:52:27">From the videos this is more like Level 2 without the highway restriction. 

It actually looks like it needs even more monitoring right now than highway Autopilot given the greater variety of scenarios the car needs to deal with and the close proximity of other traffic, curbs, parked cars, and pedestrians.
</comment><comment id="g9r4hqq" postid="jgkupo" date="2020-10-23 12:52:27">Based on my 30 seconds of googling, Tesla seems to be a weird hodgepodge of somewhere between level 2 and 3, since FSD beta can follow some traffic signals, and make lane changes.

However it requires the driver to have their hands on the wheel because their driver monitoring system sucks, and requires immediate, often unprompted intervention

Regardless back to my original point, to call Tesla's FSD "fully self driving" is straight up untrue.

It will learn overtime that it's  not a traffic light. This is the Tesla advantage. The hours and hours of training data from real-time driving. This is also why it will take years for other companies to catch up.

Also quick side note about English (took me a while to get that too, I'm assuming we have the same native language): English (and also standard German) uses different words for these: traffic light is for cars and signal is for trains (in German Ampel and Signal respectively). Swiss German doesn't make that distinction for some reason so we just call everything signal and then get confused looks.

</comment><comment id="g9n9m81" postid="jfya32" date="2020-10-22 14:01:22">The bottom line is that I trust it more than I trust myself.  I&#8217;ve missed a stop sign because my eyes can only look on one direction for traffic while the stop sign is on the other side of the road, and I ended up noticing the stop sign way too late. 

This same rational holds true for cars, bicyclists, and even pedestrians. Shit happens and then accidents are caused. I would rather my car misidentify a banner as a traffic light once per year than *ever* risk hitting a pedestrian because the human eyes biologically cannot move independently like an iguana&#8217;s eyes.

</comment><comment id="g9ooe3z" postid="jfya32" date="2020-10-22 14:01:22">10k isn't my issue with it as a non-Tesla owner.

 It's 10k, non-transferable, I guarantee you this won't be the final true autonomous hardware, and that won't be retrofit, and legally not allowed to drive without a driver in most places, etc.

When Tesla or whoever is actually able to offer a system that you can get in, choose a destination, and it will take you there, I will gladly spend 10k on that. If laws allow no driver at that time, something these companies have to prove they are extremely safe, I will be first in line with that 10k.

But right now it's pretty clear this is beta testing and in no way shape or form will this be final hardware, despite what Elon and Tesla claim.

You'd have identify 2 words . 1 word the computer would know was correct, and the other relied on the human to decipher.  I assume they would run the same word on many different tests for accuracy, but if they didn't, there should be a random swear word in a bunch of scanned books.

And I&#8217;ve still missed a stop sign because I was monitoring a bicyclist, found myself in the wrong turn lane at an interchange, and other situations which Tesla&#8217;s AP/FSD would likely have caught.  And to sit here and pretend that this has either never happened to you or is uncommon is just silly.

I trust myself to be *safe.*

Tesla autopilot vs no autopilot accident rate specifically is only twice as much, but even that's misleading. People usually only use autopilot in situations where accidents aren't likely anyway, like highway driving.

I'm honestly really curious about an actual controlled test, but I feel like if it was actually statistically safer when you control for variables, they would have already shown that. But for the record, I do think AP is pretty dope and wouldn't be *that* surprised if it was actually better than the average driver.

It's great to have the autopilot as a co-pilot, but it's a long way from being safer than you, by your account.
</comment><comment id="g9nfh5u" postid="jfya32" date="2020-10-22 14:01:22">You're correct on the idea that more data and ability to detect things makes seeing a problem more likely. But I've been driving for almost 40 years and I've never missed a stop sign. I can think of a lot of other incidents that I could cite myself that would have been a better example, like the biker or pedestrian that comes from nowhere, or the many examples we've seen of Autopilot avoiding a sideswipe because it saw what the driver didn't or couldn't react fast enough to. The biggest problem with things like the topic is the computer picking out what is and isn't a stop light or stop sign, or other traffic markers. Your human eye should still be better than the car is right now, even with more sensor ability. You shouldn't be missing stop signs.

There is no doubt that sooner or later, FSD (from any auto-maker) will dominate the roads. And I am sure, number of accidents will decrease. This especially when these cars are communicating to each other. 

The mistake here is simple: today, any car like Tesla needs to observe objects like traffic light thru cameras. Such equipment is made for humans. Traffic lights should communicate with cars in their language, means, wirelessly communicating the status for each direction. Just to name one example.

</comment><comment id="g9nidzj" postid="jfya32" date="2020-10-22 14:01:22">I don't think either of those two are true.

"more limited" may be technically true but it only matters if it is holding you back. If Cameras can detect a sign on a pole with 1cm resolution and lidar can do it with 1mm resolution, it is a non-issue if both systems detect it as a sign. What truly matters is: What is on the sign? (Lidar can't see that, or colour unless you get a fancy expensive one) And secondly, Can your system interpret what the sign means? At first glance it's confused and thinks it's a stop light but a smart system would take other contextual clues and determine it is an advertising sign instead. 

Regarding your second sentence, Cameras can capture at high frame rate at all times. Autonomy Day presentation gets into a lot of this - but there is no paucity of data that is limiting the system, that would justify the addition of an expensive lidar system.

Tesla is innovating and **delivering** at break-neck speed so some things will lack polish.

For example, with this post here, lots of people are quick to upvote and make fun of Autopilot for being "dumb". Yet can any other car in the market do this? There is no point of reference to compare this to versus other products in the market.

Also there are some highway/motorway maintenence vehicles with large signs on their rear along with lights, to direct traffic out of their lane.

Not to mention those funky zipper adjustable lanes that a special truck moves the central divider for, then they're probably also emblazoned with signage and lights while moving.

</comment><comment id="g9nkv7y" postid="jfya32" date="2020-10-22 14:01:22">Its true that cameras *could* capture at high framerate at all times. But not in a Tesla unfortunately. They are using Aptina AR132 cameras, capable of doing 720p@60fps maximum. They are probably capturing and processing data at a lower resolution and/or framerate though since I doubt the small processor can handle all that data at full res.

Lidar is only for faster and more accurate detections of any kind, assisting a visual system. Further, why not have the Lidar identifying stuff in milliseconds and then the cameras grabbing optical data on that? I am an embedded hardware &amp; software developer by day and I still think a hybrid system coupled with the radar would definitely be the best solution for autonomous cars.

In this case, it would need logic that says "I'm moving forward, but this stoplight is seemingly staying stationary or not changing in size, thus it must not be where I think it is, which means it might be bigger than I think it is, which should mean it's not a stop light."

I'm not sure if the system has that capability.

To fool it you would have to create a huge number of accounts, spoof them as good users for a long time, and then have them all lie about one point. All throughout that you have to avoid tripping any "fake user" triggers, with no feedback if you do, and avoid any kind of identifying information.

Tesla would have to be more careful of course but it's very doable. Worst case scenario they could use it for filtering and training data. They could also have the system but have highly rated tags checked by employees before Teslas treat them any differently.

</comment><comment id="g9o89nf" postid="jfya32" date="2020-10-22 14:01:22">In trying to pinpoint the feeling of - there is a difference between the two - I think this comes closest:

Auto-pilot is a tool in a plane used by humans that are trained to the tee over multiple years, and need to keep their training on going or they are no longer allowed to fly that plane until proven again they are capable. They need to be alert and ready to intervene at any time if the tool is not doing its job.


Now you put a tool in a car, that is incredibly more  sophisticated then the name sake tool of that in the plane, into the hands of every 16+ yr old with a drivers license with the hope they don&#8217;t get bored and start doing myriad of other things while driving, **because** it does 98% of everything a driver typically is expected to do.

Auto-pilot in a plane doesn&#8217;t taxi the plane to the gate, and it doesn&#8217;t cross the airstrip for you.

When something goes wrong in a plane it&#8217;s either a mechanical (design) fault or a human error. While tragic, we know pilots are not infallible, even with 2 or even more. The Auto-pilot doesn&#8217;t get the blame because the pilot should have been alert and ready. If it&#8217;s determined a serious mechanical fault, every plane that could be affected is grounded. 

290.000 airplane pilots in the world (in 2017) by vs 1.2 ***billion*** drivers (in 2015, from a Quora answer, don&#8217;t kill me) and that tiny percentage of uncovered auto-pilot situations now makes a huge difference in a car because most likely those drivers are not paying attention vs the airplane pilot. 

It&#8217;s the difference in scale of the potential use of the tool. 


Which eventually leads to the point that auto-pilot in a car will be outlawed because people can&#8217;t have nice things, and use it responsibly.

High-contrast and low-light situations are still challenging for the relatively cheap cameras found in my Tesla Model 3.

It may be a software problem in theory, but running that software may also be a hardware problem.

Humans have better much better cameras and software. Higher framerate (at least 80fps), much higher resolution. Not sure about stuff like colors. 

As for the software, we're not just better in pattern recognition, but knowing exactly what to do in every situation. FSD really needs to be able to pull over safely if something goes wrong.
</comment><comment id="g9np2ev" postid="jfya32" date="2020-10-22 14:01:22">A moving traffic light and a moving stop sign simply don't exist. Again, I'm having trouble thinking about how these would even work without FSD. Sure, there are numerous other instances of moving signs and lights that should be headed but the self driving system shouldn&#8217;t classify moving lights as a red/yellow/green traffic signal and it shouldn't classify a moving sign as a stop sign.

What I was trying to illustrate with my last comment was that there's sufficient information available and that the task is possible, just so that there's no confusion there.

The second part answering the "if the HW is powerful enough" is interesting because the human brain is incredibly good at pattern recognition. However computers are far superior in many other respects, math and memory for example. The key here is to solve the problem with the computers strengths, which given the immense amount of processing available in HW3, if thats not enough, just make HW4.
</comment><comment id="g9p2c41" postid="jfya32" date="2020-10-22 14:01:22">Software yes, cameras/eyes, only some people.

The whole point is that you don't need lidar because you can drive, as a human without it. More to the point you can also view the video from said cameras and drive like normal. This absolutely demonstrates that lidar is not required for an FSD solution. Because it may be helpful until the software is good enough doesn't mean you need it.

</comment><comment id="g9qgznv" postid="jgh5bi" date="2020-10-23 07:42:25">Funnily, this reminds me of driving school. At one point I simply didn't know better and went from the right turning lane to the left lane when exiting the junction. My driving instructor told me: "Well, that'd have been it. The driving test would be over now!"

I was a bit confused and he told me about multilane turns and that this is a crude mistake. Yep, makes sense, from then on I always payed extra attention when turning somewhere with multiple lanes. Still, especially some left turns can sometimes be extra tricky. Here is one junction, which is especially confusing. It's only one turning lane to the left but the road you enter has two lanes, one of them going directly left again (to a gas station). When going there the first time I got really confused and wobbled a bit around, just like Autpilot, until I finally found the right lane :) And I often see other people getting confused there, too - especially with license plates from other cities. So it's not just me.

TL;DR: Multilane-turning is hard. Especially on left-turns. Even for humans and especially for beginner drivers.
</comment><comment id="g9qiw00" postid="jgh5bi" date="2020-10-23 07:42:25">Actually looking closely at the 3:27 mark. You can see the car is in the left most lane, pointed at the left lane going forward, and the screen's showing the car thinks it's on the right lane. Then at 3:29 the car tries to enter what it thinks is the left lane, and instead headed right for the middle fence.

Not sure if that's logic mistake or awareness mistake, but seems to me there's a bit of confusion about lane positioning and also a lack of awareness of the central fence.

It handling it like this is surprising, I thought it would follow through then merge given how AP tries to strictly follow the law, but I think I know why it's doing this. 

My guess would be that it's currently prioritizing the law of turn to the closest lane over merging rules. So it currently (and probably wrongly) assumes that breaking the turn rule is worse then a sudden merge to correct it.

True. I wondered about the other car, too. Just that THIS is the perfect example why you should always have your hands *on* the steering wheel and apply *light force* (and being ready to apply strong force if it does sketchy movements) instead of having them close by and "I'm watching the road, no need to apply force to the steering wheel!".

If the steering wheel moves quickly and you don't have control over it, that might cause an accident. Sure, on the highway Tesla got good enough by now that this most likely won't happen - and still it's important to be handling AP like it could mess up the steering at any point. Especially in complex situations. At least until Tesla doesn't claim it to be &gt;= L3.

The car not going to the right turn lane when the lanes split initially and then forcing itself over after it had gone to the wrong lane was the act of one of assholes on the road who inconvenience and sometimes endanger other people on the road.  If you&#8217;re going to talk the entire time, at least be real and  talk about some of the problems and limitations instead of acting like the worst version red necks imagine Tesla drivers to be. I get being enthusiastic and amazed (I sure as hell am), but the voice over was just a total cringe fest that sounded like a total shill.

I believe the car in the other left lane made a U-turn otherwise this could have been a crash. They then proceed to test the exact same scenario and it fails again. The [roundabout](https://youtu.be/XkefYIU9XwM) here is pretty rough, too. I also see it stopping way too far from the cars in front of it and stop signs, too, in every single video.

</comment><comment id="g9r7ou6" postid="jgjydl" date="2020-10-23 11:36:06">I don't think people are understanding why Autopilot failed. For the first couple of interventions, AP failed because it kept trying to turn into the parking lane not because it couldn't make a turn. If there was just normal lanes then AP would have been fine as the other videos show. In fact you can see a successful turn at 6:07 when the parking lane lines aren't visible at the intersection.

As for the last intervention that's exactly why this should be considered a tool and not a replacement. You still have to intervene if it does the worst thing at the wrong time.

I couldn't tell if there was anything blocking the oncoming car or not but everyone should be using FSD like this guy.

I think some people had way too high expectations, my early NoAP experiences outside of California were pretty crappy too. Like other Tesla self driving features it will probably take a year for it to be ok, and a few years for it to be decently good.

I'm still happy with my FSD purchase.

</comment><comment id="g9qyv3l" postid="jgjydl" date="2020-10-23 11:36:06">Yeah it has some way to go for dense inner cities. Poor or ignored markings, very cluttered (no long visible stretches of curb, a lot of slightly misaligned lanes and crossings, varied obstructions), lot of speeding and aggressive driving around intersections, very small margin for error and no space to correct.

The cases where it tries to cross the road after a stop sign and a speeding truck comes from the right, and it nearly clipping a corner partially hidden by plastic barriers, those really show you have to be alert.

I can forgive it not relying on the one-way-ness of the two lane streets though, if they are at all uncertain about their map data it's better to be cautious. I can't count the number of times I've been in a city and the one way markings on the map don't match reality anymore (granted, most cases were a good while ago, just saying, it can and does change in some places.)

</comment><comment id="g9r1tal" postid="jgjydl" date="2020-10-23 11:36:06">I'll be surprised if it gets to wide release this year. Unless Tesla has training working much faster, giving this software to the masses could be literally criminal. The failure rate on turns specifically seems extremely high based on our anecdotal evidence thus far, and it doesn't fail gracefully at all. Like it will just plow into things.

One of the core features of an autonomous system must be graceful failure. If it cannot solve the problem, it must at least give the driver the best chances of preventing the mistake from becoming a case of property damage, or worse. Ideally, it should fail safely without needing intervention at all.

I don&#8217;t even see any 100% confirmation this is the new rewrite software that was going to change everything. 

The rendering is great but this data was already there, the car already saw this, it just didn&#8217;t display on the screen, Tesla has just enabled us to see what was already detected. 

I sound like a hater but i love my Tesla, maybe I&#8217;m a little underwhelmed after the hype before the release, idk.

It looks like curb and lane edges are jumping by the equivalent of 1-2 feet in some cases, which is far more than some kind of stochastic noise. It really just compromises my faith in the accuracy and stability of the system overall.

It's especially strange since the whole 4D/time thing was **the** theme of rewrite hype up until now, but that doesn't appear to apply to its general sense of topography. The system really doesn't make **any** connections about, say, the straight edge of a curb from one frame to the next? It doesn't even converge on some stable average after a 5-10 frames have elapsed? In each video, everything just keeps on bouncing wildly, as if the system has no clue these are the same, unchanging, static objects.

And the idea that this is a "debug mode" doesn't seem likely to me. I'm sure they could superficially clean it up, but if the underlying data is this chaotic, polishing the visualization doesn't really feel like a fix.

I wonder if it's safer now than after the first polishing... by which I mean, is it safer when it tries to turn into the oncoming lane every other time, or one out of one hundred times?

It's the opposite: the jittering is confirmation of ***fresh real-time raw data*** coming in.

Final view will be more like the Autopilot highway view: heavily processed outputs with everything smoothed out&#8212;but smoothing adds delays, and that is *not* something desirable for beta/debugging.

This is a question of precision, not the freshness of the data.

There are surely many ways to process that data into something more visually coherent. My concern is with the quality of the data itself. Cleaning it up after the fact is not the same as ingesting something more precise in the first place, unfortunately.

On the tesla site they price out the cars based on a 72 month loan so with that 165$ x 72 is 11,880$ over The lifetime of the loan. Tesla will make an additional 1,880$.  If they charge 200 a month then they will make 4,400 on top of the 10k they make. I don't see tesla charging more than that a month.

I know you have to pay sales tax when you purchase it, like an extra $1000 here, but does it add value to the car? e.g. 40K car costs $500 to register every year, now you buy FSD for 10K, do you have a 50K car that cost $600 a year to register.

I do one or two launches a week onto a freeway onramp that's a nice flat straightaway, but that's it. I drive fast because there's little to no traffic, but not any faster than the rest of traffic is going (and never over 80). 

Yet my first set of tires went bald after 20k (warrantied for 45k), and my second set is currently wearing fast enough to go bald after 30k (warrantied for 50k).

my bad math is...

Presume an effective cost of $11.5k (Elon said buying outright would be a better value) / 48 months (assumed avg # months people own cars) = $240 / mo (and Tesla will round up just b/c)

will be interesting to see anyhow.
</comment><comment id="g9pgdrs" postid="jg9p9o" date="2020-10-23 00:01:47">Id day expect $500+ a month, to discourage people just using it once in a blue moon and saving the cash differential.   Elon said buying  it makes more sense than subscribing if you use it regularly.  At $100 a month it would take 8 years of monthly use to compare to the purchase price; it doesn&#8217;t make sense to incentivize the cheaper option.
</comment><comment id="g9po3bw" postid="jg9p9o" date="2020-10-23 00:01:47">That seems low based on how Tesla is valuing it at $10k.

Assume the car is on the road for 15+ years. Now, obviously Tesla doesn't expect reoccurring subscriptions for every single month, but ultimately they need to at the very least break even for the initial hardware investment. Of course, R&amp;D and sever costs etc. would also need to be considered.

Unless you plan to use the network to make money the value isn't anywhere close to that price IMO. Many consumers, myself included, don't plan on sharing my car with anyone. I'd want to use FSD to ease my commute (which I don't make any longer).

At $500/mo, hell even at $200/mo, I'd need to get A LOT of utility to warrant that price. 

We're likely at least a year away from the software being ready, and even more before regulators will prove it for level 4. I think Elon is delusional to price it where is at.

This is what people see and get immediately turned off on the thought. Why the hell would an average consumer buy a 10k software package on an already expensive car, they may as well get the next trim up. On a subscription base why would the average person pay anywhere over $100 a month, when they already have a car payment. It doesn&#8217;t make sense when basic autopilot is already good enough. This is going to be for techies and someone who doesn&#8217;t care about dropping 10k on something they can do themselves.

If you've got a 30 min commute and you do it 20 times a month, that's 20 hours saved. Value your time at $25/hour? That's your breakeven. If you bought a $50K+ car, you probably earn more than $25/hour. Now, you might not value your time at that, but it's the math that would make sense. (FYI this is likely \~10K miles per year just commuting, so it's on the high end of average.)

Now, can you convince consumers to part with $500/month? Almost certainly not.
</comment><comment id="g9qfqli" postid="jg9p9o" date="2020-10-23 00:01:47">People are already buying it at $8000. It's estimated about 1/3 of sales opt for that option. They have no reason to give up that revenue to try to attract people who aren't willing to pay that price, if that was their point they'd just charge $4k for it and call it a day.

I would think they would want to target the breakeven at \~5 years. That puts it at $166, so round up to $199 to make it a slam dunk.

It wouldn't be outrageous to make it $299 and get the breakeven around 36 months, or just about the typical term of a lease.

(15k after)  There's no way I'm paying that for a car that could at any point get destroyed and then I lose it that functionality (non-transferable).   Insurance companies wouldn't cover it.

If it's 100$ per month, it would take 10 plus years to equal that up front cost.

But do the math -- if she keeps the car for 3 years and it saves her an hour per day she uses it, lets say 300 days a year, then $3000/yr means $10 per hour.

For some people, $10/hr is worth it.
</comment><comment id="g9qc3vm" postid="jg9p9o" date="2020-10-23 00:01:47">Plenty of people have jobs where they need to get 40+ hours of work done a week, can do *some* of it from a car mostly anywhere, and driving in their car eats into that. So you can get some work done in the car and actually "save" the time. I agree it's not perfect, but it's how the math works.

There is no planet where the Tesla network costs $0.20/mile. In fact, there's very few outcomes where the Robotaxi idea ever works on these vehicles. I think by 2030, someone could have perfected some kind of Robotaxi fleet, but it's likely to be custom vehicles for a variety of reasons. I'm doubtful for insurance/maintenance reasons that these would be personal vehicles. In this world, owning a personal vehicle would be reserved for those that need extremely frequent long distance trips, or simply want it for luxury. (Compare to people that have personal drivers now.)

Once that front bumper gets a build up on it you're done. Cant even use cruise control let alone Autopilot.

Would not be surprised if they had to retrofit improved sensors or cameras. 

Also possible there will be multiple levels of full self driving, like another level called "complete autonomous". 

Level 5 robotaxi level could require  higher res cameras with improved optics, as well as improved radar, and potentially left / right radar for high speed 70mph intersection crossing.

Really depends on how well the software can compensate for low res hardware... Which is likely much more than we'd anticipate.

</comment><comment id="g9ovq7b" postid="jg75rz" date="2020-10-22 21:54:00">They may need to retrofit to support regulatory approved driverless FSD.

I've said previously (and got downvoted) the real reason FSD is going up is to cover the future retrofit costs of the new driverless hardware a fully qualified driverless car will need.

No way a driverless Tesla will be allowed without a backup sensor that works in fog, snow, and heavy rain.  Vision breaks down here where radar does not.

Use an ESA radar.  Vision system + depth processing produces a 3d point cloud similar to radar.

It's my belief Dojo is to train a new neural network bootstrapped from the vision solution to work on the ESA radar data.

ESA radar will need to be consumed differently.  That's a lot of hard work.  The simpler solution is take your current system that categorizes hazards, transform the data into a similar form as the new sensor (3d point cloud), and use it to train a neural network how to spot the same obstacles from purely radar data (also a 3d point cloud).
</comment><comment id="g9q09ow" postid="jg75rz" date="2020-10-22 21:54:00">Vice versa is also true. They produce massive quantities for nearly every auto maker, so their per unit costs are very low. Not every supplier is against Tesla.

Having had an S Class Mercedes with their &#8220;pilot&#8221; system, the one thing that is noticeably absent on the Tesla is a rear facing radar.  Ultrasonic sensors (at least the current ones) don&#8217;t cut it.

Nice thing about driving is, in general, all the hazards are in front of you (other than you merging into someone).  Or at one time they were in front of you and you've passed them.

Ultrasonics need to be fixed (maybe those get retrofit as well), but they should work fine for blindspot detection.

So as we think about true FSD, and you have a constantly blinded rear camera (rain, snow, etc), how do you ever really get to FSD other than in places like Southern California with its lack of rain and snow without a system that can see through weather - like radar.

I said to my son who was traveling with me that they need something (like air blowing over the camera) to fix the blinded back camera.  

Why I suggested a rear facing detailed radar system like they use in the front of the car and like my Mercedes and BMW systems had for years.

</comment><comment id="g9p3d0n" postid="jg75rz" date="2020-10-22 21:54:00">Correct, but blind spot radar isn't directional so it doesn't solve that problem either.

BLIS radars will alert, but the human still checks if it's alerting for the proper vehicle threat.

A car sitting 2 lanes over 15 feet back will trigger the same return as one that is 1 lane over and 20 feet back.

The one that's 1 lane over is your worry.

I like Teslas approach of multiple phased ultrasonics but for whatever reason their current sensor can't do what they wanted.

Remember, Tesla actually has 6 rear ultrasonics.  Clearly they wanted to do a phased detection system.

</comment><comment id="g9oztix" postid="jg75rz" date="2020-10-22 21:54:00">The belief that ultrasonic doesn't see very far is false.

Generally ultrasonic is good to about 10-15 feet, which is more than enough for detecting if the lane you're merging into is occupied (and the next lane too).

The issue is Teslas sensors are buggy for some reason.

</comment><comment id="g9q7vct" postid="jg75rz" date="2020-10-22 21:54:00">I was thinking a rear facing radar.  At highway speeds (where the differential speeds can get pretty large), the ultrasonics don't have enough reach.  We'll see if the depth perception from vision has improved with the FSD beta rewrite.  Augmenting vision with radar sounds like a win, just like they do facing forward.

Just looking to cover the case where the car (automatically) changes lanes while some a-hole goes flying by.  I've kept confirmation of lane changes on largely for that reason.

I know it'd add cost, but hardware costs keep coming down, and maybe Tesla will be successful in bringing it in-house to further reduce that.

&gt;A car sitting 2 lanes over 15 feet back will trigger the same return as one that is 1 lane over and 20 feet back.

Tesla gets rough point cloud of the their current radar, and it sounds like other vendors have gone well beyond that.  So I think you can differentiate the position of those two vehicles.  The current gen is by no means perfect, but is great for augmenting vision.

But one of Musk&#8217;s promises is that today&#8217;s hardware will give you a car that can be an autonomous taxi.  

The truth is technology gets better.  Sensors get better.  Now kudos to them for offering a free upgrade to version 3 hardware.  I think it will be a more difficult task with what they will need to make this car an autonomous taxi.

Technically speaking it&#8217;s legal. California law only requires stopping before the limit line but does not state how far behind the limit line. 

However, in a 2015 case, the Appellate court disagrees with this interpretation (People v. Overing). Roughly summarized, their ruling says you have to stop at a place where other motorists could see you well enough to respect right of way laws. Which I think the car did. 

 &#8220;Given that the right-of-way laws could not be safely respected from the location where defendant stopped, there was substantial evidence supporting his conviction.&#8221;

</comment><comment id="g9o3zni" postid="jg2u28" date="2020-10-22 18:22:39">To be fair it's only barely over 3000 TOTAL cars sold in Iceland year-to-date. Pretty small sample. And islands are fantastic places for EVs because long distance travel in a car isn't even a discussion. Further, making electricity locally through whatever is available on the island is so much more cost effective than shipping in crude oil or refined petrol and/or diesel.

That said, it is nearly 700 miles to drive a lap of the island. The bizarro and frustrating thing, to me, is that the existing Superchargers are all in Reykjavik where likely most of the owners also live. There appear to be a couple more going up away from the city which makes a LOT more sense. According to PlugShare there are quite a lot of charging stations already out there so that's good.

The super charger MUST be in the destination! Or near it.

When you drive in the mountains, you expect another 3 to 5 hours of driving AFTER you get there. It&#8217;s not like the beach. You don&#8217;t touch it and run back.

You CANT TAKE YOUR FUCKING TESLA ON A DRIVE IN THE GREAT SMOKEY MOUNTAINS in any sensible way. TN people have been tweeting Elon for years now..

It&#8217;s so dangerous to take a Tesla cruising or to go exploring in the mountains with a Tesla. Only real way is to camp overnight at an RV park... or commit hours of the few hours of daylight you have to trickle charging.

I&#8217;m flabbergasted mountain top super chargers hasn&#8217;t been a priority. Again, I want to emphasis 3 hours of driving AFTER getting to the mountains is totally normal.

Anyways. It&#8217;ll happen when it happens, but you got to have a super charger near the top of every major mountain more than about an hour apart. These are cruising destinations, not drive through towns like Amarillo. You can&#8217;t afford spending 3+ hours to find a charge station before getting back to your drive or it&#8217;s pointless.

It&#8217;s just not a priority right now. I find it obnoxious.

I spent two hours going back and forth on that road in my Model 3 about a year ago, and it was some of the most fun I've had in my almost 20 months of ownership. I had planned to keep going until my charge level forced me to head back towards Knoxville, but unfortunately a Charger rolled over on the road and it was closed. Luckily there didn't appear to be any major injuries from the accident. If not for that, a supercharger would have allowed me to spend as much time as I pleased there, and made one of the best driving roads in the country much more accessible to Tesla owners.

&gt;Quick summary of the #FSDBeta:
It&#8217;s impressive for a computer but it has a long way to go before it feels like a professional driver. If anything it feels like a teen learning to drive for the first time. It makes mistakes, tries to correct them and sometimes it gives up entirely

Kind of what I expected, think the other guys are a bit over hyping things. This is early on in what is supposed to be a rewrite, of course it's impressive, but it's going to take time for it to mature.

15min video of clips throughout the day from Tesla Raj. I had to mute the dumb voice over lol

Someone correct me if I&#8217;m wrong but isnt it illegal to cross/change lanes during a solid white line, like at 6:16? Pretty sure that could get you pulled over

</comment><comment id="g9nxvkr" postid="jftx5l" date="2020-10-22 07:45:49">A random thought. So let's assume with true FSD you have zero need for side mirrors. If so, what range improvements might we get on highways as those mirrors apparently [increase drag, reducing range](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-roadster-cybertruck-no-side-mirror-nhtsa/). Very curious. Also what if the mirrors could stay folded in when FSD is activated and then open when not. Anything on that?

Worth noting this route is mostly highway it seems. The 2 interventions each way could easily be in the parts that aren't highway, i.e. the FSD parts.

1. these pretty animated looking FSD screens - are they just for beta use or will these be the new visuals once this is publicly released?
2. you know how when you startup AP it states to "keep your hands on the wheel, etc..", well when these cars make right and left turns, will the driver have to keep his or her hands on the wheel as this is occuring?

In theory, self-training will allow the machine to potentially get noticeably better every single day.

From the clips we have seen its obviously apparent this is a huge step forward regardless of anything else. This isn't the end its actually the beginning. This is the re-write code that is driving using vision and the 2.0 neural net. 

 1) I don't think the vehicles are yet fully utilising the FSD computer, it may take sometime before the full processing power of the hardware has to be employed. 

2) The neural net learns as it drives around, so actually what we want at this stage are people encountering as many issues as possible, all be it in a safe manner thanks to the human owner that is babysitting the car. This trains the system and makes it better for the whole fleet. I think once this thing goes into wide release, improvement in the system should be rapid.

As a result, the system is probably undershooting its "true" capabilities..at the moment.

How far, of course, is the question.

Nowadays these features are, for the most part, quite solid. And back then they didn't have nearly as many cars to gather data from, less sophisticated natural network analysis in the cars, and they lacked the experience on how to use that information.

</comment><comment id="g9qrb7o" postid="jftx5l" date="2020-10-22 07:45:49">Yeah, it messed up that right turn at 6:16 on quite a bit. Although those lane markings look extremely weird to me as a human too - I'm not familiar with American roads much, but I just saw it sit with the right blinker on for a while and only noticed that there actually is a narrow turning lane behind the bike lane when it was already stopped at the light. After looking at it again, it should have pulled across the beginnig bike lane earlier and approached the intersection already hugging the right curb.

Overall, it still does some weird things, in this video especially sitting with a blinker on for a while waiting for the traffic to completely clear instead of changing lanes early on. But it's an amazing step up from the currently available Autopilot. And I'm sure they will iron out many issues quickly with the amount of test data and disengagements coming in from a public beta.

On the video itself: recording with a split view is great, this is how you want to demo this tech properly. Voiceover and music are horrible. But very watchable muted :)

</comment><comment id="g9p8j4a" postid="jftx5l" date="2020-10-22 07:45:49">This one is interesting since it shows that even when it had trouble, it still made a decision that got back on track instead of freezing up or completely freaking out.  This is more important than simply being able to make turns and stops.

Still had hoped it'd be able to see arrows on the road and be able to know what to do.  The right turn was also more (probably needlessly) cautious than some of the other videos.  I wonder if different vehicles might react differently.

</comment><comment id="g9pd8jy" postid="jftx5l" date="2020-10-22 07:45:49">I disagree with the negative comments on this. It didn't do anything unsafe that I saw and that's the most important thing. Driving a little jerky is more uncomfortable than dangerous.

People may not want to hear it but in urban and suburban situations slowing down really increases safety. You have more time to react and the other participants have more time as well.

To illustrate: if I'm going 80 miles an hour in a city street the pedestrian walking out in the middle of the street looking at his iphone has milliseconds to hear and react to my car. Conversely, If I'm going 5 mph he has seconds to hear or see me out of the corner of his eye and he can react. And I, as the driver,  have more time to react as well.

Of course you're not going to go 5 mph but I've timed myself and I've had my friends try it out as well. In most urban  areas If you go as fast as possible, you'll save 0 to a couple of minutes even in a half hour  of driving. You'll just be spending more time at a stoplight.

RL in general is impractical for most real life applications.

The edge cases are also problematic for human drivers. It's what the law is meant for, to strictly regulate behavior of all the subjects in traffic. There should not be (unregulated) edge cases. I guess FSD would simply not work where no road is detected, or not existing in the navigation.  
  
A big problem for FSD is human behavior. Will pedestrian cross the street or is he just standing there? Is the car waiting at the light, or parked? Humans can understand the fine difference, by observing behavior of others.

It can take an educated guess on the overall shape of the roundabout even if it does not see the whole of it, based on the hundreds (thousands?) of roundabouts it has been trained on. It also takes cues from the surroundings that are visible to the cameras. 

This does mean that if it encounters a strangely-shaped roundabout it may have trouble inferring its shape. That&#8217;d be an edge case.

And then obviously update the image as it's able to see more while circling around.  Similar to how a human coming up to a roundabout would make the same assumption but still be looking to see if it's some crazy none-roundabout.

USAA, offers a policy endorsement that adds a flat 20% markup on the vehicle value at the time of loss, and you can buy the coverage regardless of how old the vehicle is. So how it's written varies by insurer.

As a damage appraiser I'd recommend taking a photo of the screen in the car that shows both the VIN and the upgrades in the same shot. That way if the car ever gets totaled in a way that the screen is destroyed or not-easily powered-up, you can save the time of having to wait for the insurer to go verify everything directly with Tesla.

</comment><comment id="g9owge6" postid="jftx5l" date="2020-10-22 07:45:49">This is dead on. One of the biggest benefits to it currently is the ability to only focus on surroundings, obstacles and hazards. Road trips even with the current suite are so much more relaxed. I still maintain focus but I don&#8217;t have to worry about staying in the lane, maintaining speed or distance from others, looking at maps to see where the interchange is and what lane I need to be in. All I have to do is look for problems. Driver fatigue on long road trips is almost non-existent. Until you experience an 8 hour road trip with it, it&#8217;s hard to fully appreciate the amount of stress it alleviates.
</comment><comment id="g9ori6f" postid="jftx5l" date="2020-10-22 07:45:49">Yeah, this is actually another reason for my recent focus on figuring out if I want it or not.

</comment><comment id="g9qakwp" postid="jftx5l" date="2020-10-22 07:45:49">There's a very 'long tail' of odd circumstances which require human level intelligence and cultural context to handle correctly. This is simply one of the most obvious. Let's jack it up a bit: Can it recognize and react appropriately to a non-cop directing traffic at an accident, before first responders arrive? Can it realize that its just a kid doing the Macarena?

Do you think the authorities will allow a driverless car on the road that can't handle the above, and ignores cops?

</comment><comment id="g9na5dy" postid="jftx5l" date="2020-10-22 07:45:49">Do yourself a favor. Go ahead and preorder the Cybertruck now with the $100 refundable deposit and make sure to select that you do want the FSD option. Preordering now locks in the FSD price, and if you get the base RWD model and hold that reservation for two or three years till the RWD model is manufactured, you'll have the chance to see how much FSD improves over the next two or three years. At that point, when Tesla contacts you to arrange delivery, you can simply cancel your preorder and get your $100 back or, if FSD improves significantly and you now want it, you can go through with the purchase. If FSD does improve a lot, it's pricewill go up and so will the value of vehicles that have it. You don't actually want the Cybertruck? Doesn't matter. If the FSD improves significantly you can buy the truck and immediately sell it for a profit. Then take that money and buy whatever Tesla you do want or, if you want to keep the cash, keep half of it for yourself and mail the other half to me at Scruff Mcgruff, Chicago, Illinois, 60652.

They are still going to collect the data from every car they sell and they probably want a small number of very eager early adopters.
</comment><comment id="g9n7uhu" postid="jftx5l" date="2020-10-22 07:45:49">If you think of it as buying the ability to use all your time in the car as a passenger, it becomes worth a lot.  If they can get to the point where it totally works, it gets rid of a lot of stress, lets you do reading or whathaveyou, etc.  It's like having a driver that you don't have to pay.  That's going to be worth a lot to a lot of people (and that's without the car-sharing angle).  Would they sell twice as many packages at $5K?  Maybe, and they'll definitely do some adjustments to see.  But price optimization is a hard problem that requires looking at data; $5K is already an expensive option; and for a bunch of people, FSD (assuming it succeeds) is a must-buy.
</comment><comment id="g9n3gfx" postid="jftx5l" date="2020-10-22 07:45:49">They eventually don't even want to sell the cars though. I'm sure they'll adjust the price downward if they truly need to drive more widespread adoption.

It is a nice feature but FSD, if it is reliable, is like a dashcam. Nothing noteworthy will happen most of the time you're using it and then there will be three seconds where it pays for every penny you spent on the software. Maybe someone to my left decided they wanted to make a last minute lane change without doing a shoulder check. Or perhaps I would get tunnel vision from focusing on a potential hazard to my left and don't see a jaywalker entering my lane from the right.

With this rewrite, FSD would allow the car to follow a route from A to B especially on city streets where those type of scenarios can occur. I would still be paying attention but the car's ability to have 360 vision and instant reaction time would make my commute a lot less stressful. Plus any driver will be able to process their surroundings faster and better if Navigate on Autopilot is handling directions and motor functions.

My money (literally and figuratively) is going to be on the 25k car they talked about on battery day. [Elon said it would be 25k with full autonomy](https://youtu.be/l6T9xIeZTds?t=6999), and while I have some doubts about that, my fingers are crossed.

In the real world what happens is they're totaling your car and you say "hey what about my FSD?" but your car is already sitting in a Copart or IAA lot 65 miles away.

</comment><comment id="g9mj8xn" postid="jftx5l" date="2020-10-22 07:45:49">In earlier versions of the Waymo (and other companies) system the LIDAR was used to localize based on premapped streets and provide some contrasting &#8220;truth&#8221; for the image recog and driving policy to verify with. 

My current understanding is that Google has had to rewrite the system such that LIDAR is either used in concert with other sensors to verify the road scene (like an airbus flight control system) or its entirely a backup system which they have largely supplanted with camera based computer vision.
</comment><comment id="g9mj3z7" postid="jftx5l" date="2020-10-22 07:45:49">Lidar is to localize in map really accurately and create 3d maps yeah, the problem is if you need to localize sub milimeter is that really driving? That's not definitely how humans drive, it's not a global solution and it's not scalable, expensive af to develop too. You should do perception with cameras and learn driving policies from humans, not hand code them.

</comment><comment id="g9npbzx" postid="jftx5l" date="2020-10-22 07:45:49">This is how roughly I purchased. I built up a bit of a down payment, and had one on reserve through Tesla. Then, while that one was being shipped, I found the other used deal, and jumped on that instead. I lost my 100 dollar reservation on the original Tesla, but still saved a lot of money instead on a 3rd party purchase. I would say, when you do have your down payment ready, be ready to act quick, and be ready to possibly drive to another state to pick it up.

One thing that was kind of a pain in the ass was getting on the Tesla app when not purchasing directly through Tesla. You have to send them some stuff via email to prove you are the owner of the car. Took a few days, luckily the previous owner was still on the account so I could supercharge on the way home. Sorry previous owner, hope those few bucks of supercharging that might have ended up on your account didn't break you. 

Also, just an opinion, but I feel like the LR AWD's are going to hold their value longer than SR+ or even the LR rear-wheel drive ones - models that are discontinued.
</comment><post id="jg0wxs" title="Tesla refuses to admit my model 3 has a flawed bumper design" date="2020-10-22 16:43:28">I saw the post about model 3's having a flaw resulting in bumpers coming off in water puddles. During a rainstorm, mine did just that a few months ago.

After a few hours of trying to reach somebody, my service center emailed. "The design defect only applies to vehicles built before May 21, 2019." They admit to the defect and say mine was built 28 days after this meaning I have no defects and my bumper is "fine". This also means Tesla's known about the defect for over a year but never mentioned it until now.

Meanwhile, my car ended up bumper-less after a normal rainstorm, which apparently is no longer a defect now and costs $1500. Another important note is my Model 3 leaks from the bottom, floods behind the pedals and into the footwells during heavy storms. When I brought it into service, I told the employees, who were completely unfazed and said that just happens sometimes because of how the car is designed. How does interior vehicle flooding "just happen", leaving me with soaked carpets and a car I have to air out and dry on my own when driven through water so shallow it doesn't even reach over the wheels? So much for driving it like a boat as Elon says. Is anyone else having this experience?

Edit: For the vinyl wrap, I removed the chrome trim, side cameras, interior door panels and mirrors. I didn't remove or change any of the body panels, I just wrapped around them.

For real though I'm actually starting to get annoyed. Have to take my 3 in for service again because my steering wheel is squeaking BAD. Which is a ridiculous problem to have on a luxury vehicle. Already had both my bumpers replaced under warranty because the paint was coming off like a month after purchase. Except they call it a "goodwill repair" so their warranty numbers don't look so bad. Also had to get a control arm replaced.

What do you mean by this? The top of the wheels or the middle where they are attached? Ok, let me put this differently: Does the water go higher than the bottom of the car? So over the bottom of the doors? Or is it simply rain intruding the car when it stands still in the driveway?

Also: Is the car at factory height or did you lower the suspension or anything?

You may ask, why not buy an E Tron then. I wouldn&#8217;t be considering a Tesla if the E Tron had better range. That&#8217;s the only reason I&#8217;m considering a Model Y.

They specifically told me that adding a power trunk would void my warranty. They told me that chrome deleting my chrome at a professional auto shop could void my warranty if they are removing parts of the panels to wrap them. 

I don't agree with it at all, but I suspect that they're thinking you fiddled with the bumper to wrap your car and aren't admitting fault. Especially because your model doesn't fall within the parameters that they have (probably erroneously) set.

</comment><comment id="g9nsg62" postid="jg0wxs" date="2020-10-22 16:43:28">I would go so far as to argue that the Tesla's(especially the 3/Y) are not luxury vehicles. They just happen to share the same price point, but as industry leading electric vehicles that push the envelope of technology and safety. There is very little about the interior of the 3 that screams "luxurious" to most people. The Model 3 is more focused on simplicity, clean lines, and use of sustainable materials.  

I still have all sorts of fitment issues and my biggest gripe is that the driver's seat controller (to move seat forward and back) is just dangling on the side of my seat which Tesla refuses to fix without replacing the whole seat. To make matters worse, they won't replace the passenger seat to match so then the replacement seat would look completely different from the passenger seat due to having the 1st generation seat design. To add, my sister-in-law just picked up her new Y about a month ago and I could still see some of the same fitment issues present in the interior that impact my 1st gen (under 12,000 VIN) Model 3 -but I didn't have the heart to tell her, she was so head over heels in love. The exterior fitment looked a lot better though so that was a plus.     

If you ever sit in a Mercedes of equal price, it's seats, interior materials, fitment, shape of the door handles and steering wheel, feeling of the knobs and switches, they all scream luxurious (and have better audio on the higher end models). A non-AMG model also drives like it's on a cloud and you can just barely even hear the road underneath due their their use of active noise cancellation in the cabin. Tesla needs to keep the costs low to help drive sales and as the tech improves and batteries become more affordable, maybe then they can afford to offer more premium cabins worthy of the title "Luxury" that they compete against.

But just keep in mind, new bumper design doesn't mean you can race through giant puddles either. The immense pressure from deep water going through puddles is actually huge. Like, ever get pulled up by a speed boat to water ski? That's a lot of force.

If you google things like "rainstorm puddle bumper ripped off" you'll find that this happens to all sorts of cars in areas prone to heavy rains and stagnant \~1 foot deep water.

I did a diy chrome delete with pre-cut pieces, but no way would I feel confident doing the whole car with rolls of wrap as a starting point. Is that your first time doing it? How long? Advice?
</comment><comment id="g9nyhd4" postid="jg0wxs" date="2020-10-22 16:43:28">Idk. Not to be that guy, but those panels look like you wrapped them with the bumper removed. Tesla may also suspect the same thing. If you removed the bumper and didn't apply it correctly then you're on the hook. Not saying you did, but it sure looks like a damn fine wrap job and the good ones remove panels to wrap around the quarter panels (like yours). Sick color wrap though!
</comment><comment id="g9nvb30" postid="jg0wxs" date="2020-10-22 16:43:28">Bingo! Which is why I would bite the bullet on $1500 and go elsewhere/save money DIY if Tesla are being buttholes about it.

</comment><comment id="g9ori83" postid="jg0wxs" date="2020-10-22 16:43:28">I went through this with a $40k Dodge Charger R/T that I bought brand new in 2011. The paint was flaking off the rear bumper from the seams out. Car had less than 1,000 miles on it and they fought me tooth and nail about it being "parking lot damage." Unfortunately it was only the first of many problems with that POS. Squeaky steering too oddly enough. 

I really hate to see Tesla treating their customers the same way. I've had my fair share of service visits with this car for dumb shit but they have been *mostly* awesome about it. The only thing they jerked me around on was the underbody shield ripping in water, even after the TSB on it. Took them almost a year to get it rectified while I drove around with a hole in the bottom of my car.

I'm comparing my car to literally any other new car, I'm not asking it to be like a Maybach. This is going to be the 4th time I've had to get Tesla to fix something in the &lt;18 months I've owned the car. It's kind of annoying. I mean, I'm glad they've fixed everything so far without me having to fight it and I love the car, but it's still kind of sad.

Powertrain has been fine. I did have to get a control arm replaced (warranty).

I also own a Model 3, I just think it's sad how people are defending Tesla for absurd quality control/fit &amp; finish issues like they're a small struggling indie company. They have a $400 billion market cap right now, they don't need to be pinching pennies and cutting corners on soundproofing/heated steering wheels/refusing to recall cars.

Thankfully, EV tech is getting cheaper every year, so we'll definitely see more competitive options by the time I'm looking at my next car.

If the car stops finding a path forward it&#8217;s nice to know that it&#8217;s because it thought it&#8217;s lane was suddenly only 2 feet wide.

When the software reaches hands off the wheel and pedals, I agree we want that to be a solid line.  We&#8217;re currently in the odd period where we need to weigh accurately representing perception and driver distraction.

Even if it's capable of driving extremely reliably, the way it does things like "identify where the line is" is not 100% precise, it's just whatever unknown processing it figured out that gets the right answer most of the time.

</comment><comment id="g9obi14" postid="jfva7u" date="2020-10-22 09:41:38">4D. rather than identifying and re-identifying the object from single frames, they're using multi-sensor (3D) AND time-based (+1D) identification and tracking of objects now. one would expect that to be more stable

Tesla at least has radar which I think I like the added reliability of.

With what we know about the rewrite, wouldn't we expect the AI to take in historical data as well to smooth the output for us?

</comment><comment id="g9ob221" postid="jfva7u" date="2020-10-22 09:41:38">The resolution is pretty low and spread out over a wide lens which doesn't help matters. It won't be nearly as good at seeing down a crossroad as say, a dedicated HD camera pointed that way. Just like how humans use their eyes to look to the left and right even though we *could* see both ways with our peripheral vision.
</comment><comment id="g9ntd55" postid="jfva7u" date="2020-10-22 09:41:38">Hmm, unless they have updated it in the last few months, they didn&#8217;t smooth things on the current visualization. When I look at that I see cars around me bouncing all over the place. It makes it look really bad in my opinion.
</comment><comment id="g9p13ws" postid="jfva7u" date="2020-10-22 09:41:38">I certainly hope so. As someone with only a cursory understanding of machine learning in general, it boggles my mind that whatever algorithms have been identified/trained to be optimal pattern recognizers are so *insanely* inconsistent from one millisecond to the next. If the algorithms really *really* worked, then I would expect extremely smooth output to emerge naturally simply because the moment-to-moment results would be extremely consistent - aka *accurate*.

Instead, all of this jitter screams of massive inconsistency in the basic function of identitying where objects are in relation to the car from one moment to the next.

Sure, that can all be smoothed with a moving average or other algorithm, but Jeeeeezzus it terrifies me to think that the very best state of the art DNN by one fo the best dev teams using the world's best hardware can't consistently pinpoint the shape and location of a *goddamn truck right next to the bloody car* from one second to the next.

I sincerely hope it doesn't matter. But this absolutely does NOT inspire confidence.

HD maps is navigating a maze when you can see the whole maze start to finish.

You could probably train it to be more time consistent with its outputs by incorporating some prior bias/knowledge, e.g. car is not moving, prediction should be stable, or keeping the track of past predictions and refining them over time

The dev visualizer you see here is built for the new FSD architecture and there will be an accompanying consumer version coming soon. This has nothing to do with what most people have today.

I&#8217;m talking about [this video](https://youtu.be/kJD5R_yQ9aw), which, in my opinion, their visualization, with assistance from the maps looks very similar to Tesla&#8217;s dev display. I&#8217;m not saying anything bad about either company. I&#8217;m just saying that from what I see from this update, I have faith in their self driving tech even more so now becuase of mobile eyes demo.
</comment><comment id="g9mw7dp" postid="jfva7u" date="2020-10-22 09:41:38">Pretty neat stuff going on. I&#8217;m just happy tesla let&#8217;s us use it now (or at least December maybe) rather just seeing a demo on a car that we won&#8217;t be able to buy.
</comment><comment id="g9nul34" postid="jfva7u" date="2020-10-22 09:41:38">In the current visualizer, you can observe vehicles jittering around quite often. Either flashing in and out of existence or just moving about on the screen kind of like the images on this simulation do. I could see why it needs to behave like that to be safely responsive, but I think the visuals would be more comforting if they smoothed them or gave them some kind of dead band.
</comment><comment id="g9pq3fe" postid="jfva7u" date="2020-10-22 09:41:38">Huh. I had the visualization of a car go *through* me today, going around a curve alternating between in line with the lane and canted at up to 45&#176; towards me. That's running 2020.40.4.

</comment><comment id="g9nxim0" postid="jfva7u" date="2020-10-22 09:41:38">I think there is a miscommunication, but I am not failing to understand that this is a new version of the autopilot, that&#8217;s a pretty glaringly simple concept. 
What I am saying is this looks jittery. I am also saying the current visualization has jittery characteristics, which is fully released to the fleet and as polished as Tesla would ever get it. Since both versions have jittery characteristics, I don&#8217;t see the rollout from the limited test to the full fleet being something I would expect to fix the jitteriness shown here.

</comment><comment id="g9nht0t" postid="jfva7u" date="2020-10-22 09:41:38">Yeah having the mapping just makes it easier because when you avoid an obstacle you know exactly what you're driving into on the other side.

In essence you know your path to your destination at all times no matter the obstacle.

Obstacle avoidance becomes finding the shortest and safest route back onto your known path.

Tesla uses maps, but I don't think it's HD maps (street information that contains exact lane counts and locations to inch level precision).
</comment><comment id="g9qbjx0" postid="jfva7u" date="2020-10-22 09:41:38">The old visualisation is jittery because the FSD computer has the memory of a silicon goldfish and the display unit can only do so much. The new one is jittery because it does not even try to smooth the data---at the moment it's more important that the driver knows exactly what the FSD computer sees.

Something about when they cross into NY or NJ turns them weird.

I heard a rumor that there might be Tesla chargers going in at this Wawa. Went to check it out and there&#8217;s 8 spots with signage reading something along the lines of &#8220;Tesla 15 Minute Temporary Parking&#8221;. They&#8217;ve been doing a lot of underground digging there recently as well. Could the &#8220;15 minute&#8221; mean higher level charging, or am I reading into it too much?

If you're charging, there isn't a time limit.  It doesn't have anything to do with the speed of charging.  But they will be 250 kW ones.
